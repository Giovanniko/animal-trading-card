			<p class="textbox">Our world's fastest land animal needs a vast range to hunt and breed effectively. As their ranges have been fragmented by human development their numbers are starting to decline. In 1900 an estimated 100,000 prowled their native lands from Africa to South Asia. Recent studies put their population at 7,100. During the most recent ice-age, range limitations caused a genetic bottleneck: male sperm counts were lower and female reproductive capacity was reduced because of inbreeding. The animal is already extinct in 20+ native countries and only one healthy population of 4,000 lives in southern africa.</p>
